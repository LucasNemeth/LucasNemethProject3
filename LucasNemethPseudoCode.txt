Hello hello hello!

So I plan on making a quiz called "Does this person exist?"
I will be integrating images from the website thispersondoesnotexist.com and take some portraits of people I know in a quiz of "who is the real person?"
-have a header and a paragraph explaining the rules. 

-there will be 5 stages with 2 options for each stage. 

-each img is associated with a button. one id is the real person, the other is not. 

-create an array of objects, objects have 2 properties, one is img the other is the answer

-I will be implementing if-else functions for these stages.

	-if - you correctly guess the real person , a function will increase your score by 1 ,(maybe add an alert that congratulates you with a button saying "next level")  and it will take you to the next level. 

	else - no point, (perhaps alert that will say "too bad" next level) and take you to the next level. 

-if not an alert, stretch goal to animate a checkmark or X on the right/wrong outcome. 

-potentially add an html element in between levels telling you if you're right or wrong.

-last page will be a simple page with a section saying "Good effort, you got  x/5! Please play again" and a button that will take you to the start.

-stretch goal to implement Dunc's Algomusic (algorithm based music) into an audio player for peak unsettling uncanny valley experience!
-we'll have to figure out how to make it dynamic so that it mixes up the ids every level. or just hard code it in.

points are tracked in a variable
